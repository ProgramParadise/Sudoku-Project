# Sudoku-Project
This project contains both a Sudoku solver and generator for your use.

It is very easy to use:



<i><b>SOLVING</b></i>



In order to solve a sudoku, it is as simple as typing <b>"solve".</b>
For custom sudokus, you can enter them in either the userInput.txt file, or the user input puzzle on the main sudoku.cs file.

<b>If you enter something into the userInput.txt file, remember to uncomment line 167 (if it isn't already).</b>



<i><b>GENERATING</b></i>



In order to generate a sudoku, type <b>"generate".</b>
Once you press enter, two options will appear:

1) <b>"all at once"</b> will allow you to enter a 9x9 matrix at one time.
2) <b>"one at a time"</b> will prompt you to enter a single value at a time.

After you have entered the matrix, two more options will appear:

1) <b>"code"</b> will output into the copy-pastable form for the main file's user input.
2) <b>"matrix"</b> will output into a 9x9 square of numbers.
