# Sudoku-Project
This project contains both a Sudoku solver and generator for your use.

It is very easy to use:

In order to solve a sudoku, it is as simple as typing "solve".
For custom sudokus, you can enter them in either the userInput.txt file, or the user input puzzle on the main sudoku.cs file.

<b>If you enter something into the userInput.txt file, remember to uncomment line 167 (if it isn't already).</b>
